# Lab 07: Large neighborhood search

**Implementation of two versions of LNS – using or not local search after destroy-repair operators - for solving the Travelling Salesperson Problem with node costs and Euclidean distances.**

---

## Problem Overview

Given a set of nodes in a plane, each defined by:
- `(x, y)` coordinates,
- a node cost,

**the goal** is to select exactly 50% of the nodes (rounded up if odd) and form a Hamiltonian cycle through them, minimizing the sum of:
- the total Euclidean path length (rounded to integers),
- the total cost of the selected nodes.
